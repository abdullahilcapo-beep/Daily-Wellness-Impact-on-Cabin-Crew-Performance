# Daily Wellness Impact on Cabin Crew Performance

## Overview
This project examines how daily wellness factors influence cabin crew performance and guest experience. Using a simulated dataset, the analysis explores the relationships between workout frequency, nutrition quality, sleep duration, rest days between flights, fatigue levels, and both passenger and crew feedback.

The objective is to identify which factors have the strongest operational impact on service quality and overall performance within an aviation context.

- **Disclaimer:** No proprietary, confidential, or airline-specific data was used

### Key Variables
- Workout_Days_Per_Week
- Nutrition_Quality
- Avg_Sleep_Hours
- Rest_Days_Between_Flights
- Monthly_Flight_Hours
- Fatigue_Level
- Service_Energy_Level

## Methodology
- Designed a realistic aviation wellness–performance data model
- Generated simulated data with logical relationships between variables
- Conducted analysis using pivot tables and descriptive statistics
- Visualized insights through comparative charts
- Interpreted results from both passenger and crew perspectives

## Key Insights
### Rest and Recovery
Rest days between flights showed the strongest impact on reducing fatigue and improving overall performance.

### Nutrition and Service Energy
Higher nutrition quality was associated with increased service energy levels and stronger performance outcomes.

### Workout Frequency
Consistent physical activity correlated with lower fatigue levels, though its impact was secondary to adequate rest.

### Fatigue and Perception Gap
Higher fatigue levels were linked to a larger gap between crew self-feedback and passenger service ratings, indicating reduced self-awareness under fatigue.

## Conclusion
Daily wellness factors significantly influence cabin crew performance and guest experience. Among all variables analyzed, rest and recovery demonstrated the highest operational impact, while fitness and nutrition acted as performance enhancers when supported by adequate rest.
